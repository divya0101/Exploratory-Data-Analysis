# Exploratory Data Analysis of disney_movie datasets

In this analysis, I like to investigate few questions associated with the collection of Disney Movies datasets. I'm interested to find trend of inflation_adjusted_gross across genre and trend of movies released by Disney in each decade. My assumption is that Comedy movies generate the most revenue because the largest portion of viewers like to watch Comedy movies. In addition to this I'm finding the count of Movies by Directors and movies that have more number of parts.
